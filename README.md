# Scriptable-Browser-Playground
A web browser, built in a Swift Playground which can make use of user scripts to modify webpages on the fly.  For iPads with Swift Playgrounds 2.

This was built using Swift Playgrounds 2 (Beta 2), but I didn't consciously make use of anything specific to the Beta.  If you want to run it in the current public release version of Swift Playgrounds, minor tweaks may be required.
